\section{Review}

New tools have been discovered to analize biological systems that give better and faster results. But many of these systems are complex, because of the multiple interactions at a macro-scale and micro-scale level. The approach consists on a deep analysis of the existing model, after that, they evaluate and propose the introduction of a stochastic process on the model to benefit of SHS theory. The authors expect run these models on computers: "The hope is to substitute costly and time-consuming in vitro or in vivo experiments or provide guidance for those experiments and generate better hypotheses."\cite{xiangfang_li_review_2017:1}
