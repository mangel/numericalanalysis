\paragraph{1} List the matrix form of the numerical solver techniques for solving the heat diffusion equation.
\paragraph{Solution}
\textbf{The explicit solver}:
$$ \overrightarrow{\rm U}^{n+1} = \left(I + A\frac{\Delta t a}{h^2}\right)^{n+1} \cdot \overrightarrow{\rm U}_0$$
given that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $I$ is the identity matrix.
	\item $A$ is another matrix...
	\item $\Delta t$ is the choosen parameter for time.
	\item $h$ is another parameter
	\item $\overrightarrow{\rm U}_0$ is an initial solution of the ODE.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{2} Write a program to use the explicit method to solve the diffusion equation
\begin{align*}
	u_t &= u_{xx}, t > 0, 0 < x < 1;\\
	u(0, t) &= 0; \\
	u(1, t) &= 0; \\
	u(x, 0) &= \sin{(\pi x)}.
\end{align*}
which has the exact solution:
$$u(x, t) = e^{\pi^2 t} \sin{(\pi x)}$$
(the student should check that this is indeed the exact solution). Use $h^{-1} = 4, 8, \dots, \frac{1}{1024}$, and take $\delta t$ as large as possible to maintain stability. Confirm that the approximate solution is as accurate as the theory predicts. Compute out to $t = 1$.
\paragraph{3} Please load the CVS attached to the midterm and perform constant, linear, cuadratic and cubic regression Â¿What regression fits the bests?
