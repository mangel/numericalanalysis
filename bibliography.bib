	abstract = {Stochastic hybrid systems (SHS) have attracted a lot of research interests in recent years. In this paper, we review some of the recent applications of SHS to biological systems modeling and analysis. Due to the nature of molecular interactions, many biological processes can be conveniently described as a mixture of continuous and discrete phenomena employing SHS models. With the advancement of SHS theory, it is expected that insights can be obtained about biological processes such as drug effects on gene regulation. Furthermore, combining with advanced experimental methods, in silico simulations using SHS modeling techniques can be carried out for massive and rapid verification or falsification of biological hypotheses. The hope is to substitute costly and time-consuming in vitro or in vivo experiments or provide guidance for those experiments and generate better hypotheses.},

	title = {Transcriptional stochasticity in gene expression},
	volume = {238},
	abstract = {Due to the small number of copies of molecular species involved, such as DNA, mRNA and regulatory proteins, gene expression is a stochastic phenomenon. In eukaryotic cells, the stochastic effects primarily originate in regulation of gene activity. Transcription can be initiated by a single transcription factor binding to a specific regulatory site in the target gene. Stochasticity of transcription factor binding and dissociation is then amplified by transcription and translation, since target gene activation results in a burst of mRNA molecules, and each mRNA copy serves as a template for translating numerous protein molecules. In the present paper, we explore a mathematical approach to stochastic modeling. In this approach, the ordinary differential equations with a stochastic component for mRNA and protein levels in a single cells yield a system of first-order partial differential equations (PDEs) for two-dimensional probability density functions (pdf). We consider the following examples: Regulation of a single auto-repressing gene, and regulation of a system of two mutual repressors and of an activator–repressor system. The resulting PDEs are approximated by a system of many ordinary equations, which are then numerically solved.},

	volume = {234},
	doi = {doi:10.1016/j.jtbi.2004.11.020},
	abstract = {Population diversification strategies are ubiquitous among microbes, encompassing random phase-variation (RPV) of pathogenic bacteria, viral latency as observed in some bacteriophage and HIV, and the non-genetic diversity of bacterial stress responses. Precise conditions under which these diversification strategies confer an advantage have not been well defined. We develop a model of population growth conditioned on dynamical environmental and cellular states. Transitions among cellular states, in turn, may be biased by possibly noisy readings of the environment from cellular sensors. For various types of environmental dynamics and cellular sensor capability, we apply game-theoretic analysis to derive the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) for an organism and 	determine when that strategy is diversification. We find that: (1) RPV, effecting a sort of Parrondo paradox wherein random alternations between losing strategies produce a winning strategy, is selected when transitions between different selective environments cannot be sensed, (2) optimal RPV cell switching rates are a function of environmental lifecycle asymmetries and environmental autocorrelation, (3) probabilistic diversification upon entering a new environment is selected when sensors can detect environmental transitions but have poor precision in identifying new environments, and (4) in the presence of excess additive noise, low-pass filtering is required for evolutionary stability. We show that even when RPV is not the ESS, it may minimize growth rate variance and the risk of extinction due to ‘unlucky’ environmental dynamics.},

	volume = {2013},
	doi = {doi:10.1038/mtna.2013.5},
	abstract = {Specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) designed to silence different oncogenic pathways can be used for cancer therapy. However, non-modified naked siRNAs have short half-lives in blood serum and encounter difficulties in crossing biological membranes due to their negative charge. These obstacles can be overcome by using siRNAs complexed with bolaamphiphiles, consisting of two positively charged head groups that flank an internal hydrophobic chain. Bolaamphiphiles have relatively low toxicities, long persistence in the blood stream, and most importantly, in aqueous conditions can form poly-cationic micelles thus, becoming amenable to association with siRNAs. Herein, two different bolaamphiphiles with acetylcholine head groups attached to an alkyl chain in two distinct configurations are compared for their abilities to complex with siRNAs and deliver them into cells inducing gene silencing. Our explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed that 	bolaamphiphiles associate with siRNAs due to electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions. These in silico studies are supported by various in vitro and in cell culture experimental techniques as well as by some in vivo studies. Results demonstrate that depending on the application, the extent of siRNA chemical protection, delivery efficiency, and further intracellular release can be varied by simply changing the type of bolaamphiphile used.},

@article{peter_s._swain_intrinsic_2002,
	title = {Intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to stochasticity in gene expression},
	volume = {99},
	abstract = {Gene expression is a stochastic, or ‘‘noisy,’’ process. This noise comes about in two ways. The inherent stochasticity of biochemical processes such as transcription and translation generates 	‘‘intrinsic’’ noise. In addition, fluctuations in the amounts or states of other cellular components lead indirectly to variation in the expression of a particular gene and thus represent ‘‘extrinsic’’
	noise. Here, we show how the total variation in the level of expression of a given gene can be decomposed into its intrinsic and extrinsic components. We demonstrate theoretically that simulta	neous measurement of two identical genes per cell enables discrimination of these two types of noise. Analytic expressions for intrinsic noise are given for a model that involves all the major 	steps in transcription and translation. These expressions give the sensitivity to various parameters, quantify the deviation from Poisson statistics, and provide a way of fitting experiment. Transcription dominates the intrinsic noise when the average number	of proteins made per mRNA transcript is greater than 2. Below this number, translational effects also become important. Gene replication and cell division, included in the model, cause protein numbers to tend to a limit cycle. We calculate a general form for the extrinsic noise and illustrate it with the particular case of a single fluctuating extrinsic variable—a repressor protein, which acts on the gene of interest. All results are confirmed by stochastic simulation using plausible parameters for Escherichia coli.},

	work on a method for the qualitative analysis of hybrid models of genetic regulatory networks, based on a class of piecewise-affine differential equation (PADE) models, in two directions. First, we present a refinement of the method using a discrete or qualitative abstraction that preserves stronger properties of the dynamics of the PA systems, in particular the sign patterns of the derivatives of the concentration variables. The discrete transition system resulting from the abstraction is a conservative
	approximation of the dynamics of the PA system and can be computed symbolically. Second, we apply the refined method to a regulatory system whose functioning is not yet well-understood by biologists, the nutritional stress response in the bacterium Escherichia coli.},

This experimental progress calls for the development of	appropriate computer tools for the modeling and simulation of gene regulation processes. We present a method for the hybrid modeling and simulation of genetic regulatory networks, based on a class of piecewise-linear (PL) differential equations that has been well-studied in mathematical biology. Distinguishing characteristics of the method are that it makes qualitative predictions of the behavior of regulatory systems and that it deals with discontinuities in the right-hand side of the differential 	equations. The simulation method has been implemented in Java in the computer tool Genetic Network Analyzer (GNA). The method and the tool have been used to analyze several networks of biological interest, including the network underlying the initiation of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis.},

A variety of methods for the modeling and simulation of genetic regulatory networks have been proposed in the literature. In this tutorial, the two principal approaches that have been used will be reviewed: methods based on differential equation models and stochastic models. In addition, we will indicate some alternative methods that have emerged in response to the difficulties encountered in applying the classical approaches.},

	title = {Reconstructing Metabolic Networks Using Interval Analysis},
	volume = {3692},
	abstract = {Recently, there has been growing interest in the modelling and simulation of biological systems. Such systems are often modelled in terms of coupled ordinary differential equations that involve parameters whose (often unknown) values correspond to certain fundamental properties of the system. For example, in metabolic modelling, concentrations of metabolites can be described by such equations, where parameters correspond to the kinetic rates of the underlying chemical reactions. Within
	this framework, the increasing availability of time series data opens up the attractive possibility of reconstructing approximate parameter values, thus enabling the in silico exploration of the behaviour of complex dynamical systems. The parameter reconstruction problem, however, is very challenging – a fact that has resulted in a plethora of heuristics methods designed to fit parameters to the given data.
	In this paper we propose a completely deterministic method for parameter reconstruction that is based on interval analysis. We illustrate its utility by applying it to reconstruct metabolic networks using S-systems.
	Our method not only estimates the parameters very precisely, it also determines the appropriate network topologies. A major strength of the proposed method is that it proves that large portions of parameter space can be disregarded, thereby avoiding spurious solutions.},
